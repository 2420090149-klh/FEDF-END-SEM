# Responsive Demo — README

This repository contains a small responsive HTML page that demonstrates:

- A responsive image and layout using CSS media queries (`index.html`, `style.css`).
- How to track changes and explore git history via commits and diffs.

Place the provided image attachment into `assets/logo.png` so the header logo displays correctly.

```
